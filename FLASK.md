Q)WHAT IS FLASK?
  --Flask is a web development framework created in Python language. This Framework is based on the robust 
    foundation of Jinja2 templates engine and Werkzeug comprehensive WSGI web application library.

    Flask is created by Armin Ronacher and is developed as a part of the Pallets Projects, 
    which is a collection of Python web development libraries such as Flask, Click, ItsDangerous, 
    Jinja, MarkupSafe, and Werkzeug.

Q)Why is Flask called a Microframework?

  --Flask is called a microframework because Flask only provides core features such as request,
    routing, and blueprints. For other features, such as Caching, ORM, forms, etc., we need to make use of 
    Flask-Extensions.

Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. 
It is a lightweight abstraction that works with your existing ORM/libraries

It has an inbuilt development server.
It has vast third-party extensions.
It has a tiny API and can be quickly learned by a web developer.
It is WSGI compliant.
It supports Unicode.
